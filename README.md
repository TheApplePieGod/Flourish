# Flourish

Flourish is a cross-platform 3D graphics library. It is designed to allow both high and low level interaction with the underlying graphics APIs. It is also designed to be used with a multithreaded rendering approach. Flourish supports Vulkan for all platforms with the option of switching to native Metal when running on Apple devices.

# Introduction

This library was written to replace the internal one used in the [Heart](https://github.com/TheApplePieGod/Heart) game engine. It is extremely new and heavily work in progress.
